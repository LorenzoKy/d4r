# Architecture

d4r keeps NVIDIA's DLSS library unmodified and gives it what it expects: an NGX D3D12 entry point in the game process, a CUDA driver underneath, and CUDA kernels that run. Everything between those points is translation.

## Components

| Piece | Where | Role |
|---|---|---|
| OptiScaler (in GE-Proton) | external | Hooks the game's upscaler call and forwards DLSS requests to an NGX DLL (`NvngxPath`) |
| NGX shim `d4r_nvngx.dll` | `tools/d4r_nvngx_shim.cpp` | Implements the NGX D3D12 API. Moves inputs and output between the game's D3D12 resources and CUDA, and drives the official NGX core through its CUDA API |
| NGX core + `nvngx_dlss.dll` | NVIDIA, supplied by you | The real DLSS: parameter handling, network selection, the CUDA kernels |
| CUDA bridge `nvcuda.dll` | `tools/wine_nvcuda_bridge.c` | A Wine builtin whose Windows exports forward to ZLUDA's Linux `libcuda.so`, plus d4r helpers (Vulkan memory import, asynchronous 2D copies, GPU-side waits, output redirect, linear textures) |
| ZLUDA | `patches/zluda` | CUDA driver API on HIP; compiles NVIDIA's PTX to AMDGPU code; serves native kernels in place of PTX kernels |
| Native kernels | `kernels/` | RDNA3 implementations of the DLSS network layers and parts of texture kernels |
| vkd3d-proton patch | `patches/vkd3d-proton` | Lets the shim split a D3D12 command list around the DLSS call |
| NVAPI identity | `tools/d4r_nvapi_identity.c` | Reports an Ada (sm_89) GPU so NGX selects the network weights matching the PTX ZLUDA compiles |

## One frame

With VRAM interop and split frames (the defaults when the patched vkd3d-proton is present):

1. **The game records DLSS.** Its `EvaluateFeature` call reaches the shim with the game's command list. Into that list the shim records:
   - Vulkan commands (vkd3d-proton interop) that copy colour, depth, motion vectors and optional exposure into buffers exported to HIP. Linear R11G11B10, RGB10A2, and RGBA8/BGRA8 colour inputs are blitted to RGBA16F; multichannel float exposure is blitted to R32F using its first component when the device supports the conversion.
   - A frame marker.
   - A split. vkd3d-proton submits everything the game records after the DLSS call separately, gated on a timeline semaphore reaching this frame's number.
   - At the start of that second part, a copy of the DLSS result into the game's output texture. Linear R11G11B10, RGB10A2, and RGBA8/BGRA8 outputs are converted from RGBA16F on the GPU. sRGB formats continue through host staging to preserve their existing byte interpretation.
2. **The CUDA worker queues DLSS.** A worker thread owns the CUDA context. For each frame it queues on the GPU, without waiting on the CPU:
   - a wait for the marker (`GpuWait`);
   - the input copies into CUDA arrays, or none when NGX samples the buffers in place (`LinearInputs`);
   - NGX's evaluation (NGX's own CPU synchronisations are elided with `ElideNgxSync`);
   - the result, written straight into the output buffer by the native output kernel (`DirectOutput`, preset K) or copied there.
3. **Release.** When the GPU finishes, the worker signals the timeline semaphore and the rest of the game's frame runs, now with this frame's result.

A watchdog releases any frame that never completes (for example a command list that is recorded but never executed), so the game cannot stall on DLSS.

Without the vkd3d-proton patch the shim shows the newest finished result instead (one or more frames old). Without VRAM interop, inputs and output are staged through host memory.

## Why each piece exists

- **CUDA NGX instead of D3D12 NGX.** NVIDIA's D3D12 path needs NVIDIA's driver. The CUDA path only needs a CUDA driver API, which ZLUDA provides.
- **The Ada identity.** NGX picks network weights by GPU architecture. The weights have to match the PTX that ZLUDA compiles, which is sm_89 for DLSS 310.
- **Native kernels.** ZLUDA translates NVIDIA's warp-level matrix code faithfully but slowly (register pressure, lane shuffles, per-instruction mode switches). In the DLSS 4 transformer, ZLUDA's translation also produced non-finite outputs, which the final kernel masks, so the network had no effect. The native layers fix both.
- **The GPU-side hand-offs.** With DLSS itself fast, most of the remaining gap to FSR 4 was the GPU idling while CPU threads waited on each other. Moving the waits onto the GPU raised GPU utilisation from about 95% to 99%.

## Configuration

`config/d4r.ini.default` documents every setting. `scripts/d4r_config.py` turns the file into environment variables for `scripts/run_game_d4r_optiscaler_proton.sh`, and an environment variable that is already set wins. The most useful switches:

| d4r.ini | Environment | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `[DLSS] Model` | `D4R_DLSS_PRESET` | DLSS network: `E` (CNN), `K` (DLSS 4), `M` (DLSS 4.5) |
| `[Latency] FrameAge` | `D4R_SHIM_SPLIT_FRAME`, `D4R_SHIM_MAX_IN_FLIGHT` | 0 = same-frame results; higher values pipeline frames |
| `[Kernels] NativeKernels` | `D4R_ZLUDA_NATIVE_DIR` | native kernel directory (`fast` / `exact` / `off`) |
| `[Interop] VramInterop` | `D4R_SHIM_VRAM_INTEROP` | keep inputs and output in VRAM |
| `[Interop] GpuWait` | `D4R_SHIM_GPU_WAIT` | GPU-side wait for the game's inputs |
| `[Interop] LinearInputs` | `D4R_SHIM_LINEAR_INPUTS` | NGX samples the input buffers in place |
| `[Interop] DirectOutput` | `D4R_SHIM_OUTPUT_DIRECT` | the output kernel writes the game-side buffer directly (preset K) |
| `[Interop] ElideNgxSync` | `D4R_ELIDE_NGX_SYNC` | skip NGX's internal CPU waits |
| `[Paths] JitCacheDir` | `XDG_CACHE_HOME` | where ZLUDA caches compiled kernels |

## Portable installs (the release zip)

The release zip (`scripts/package_release.sh`) is unpacked into the folder that holds a game's main `.exe`, like an OptiScaler release. Nothing in the Proton prefix or the system is changed.

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `dxgi.dll`, `OptiScaler.ini` | OptiScaler 0.9.4. Its INI sets DLSS as the DX12 upscaler and `OptiDllPath=d4r`, so OptiScaler loads the shim as `d4r\nvngx.dll`. |
| `d3d12.dll`, `d3d12core.dll` | the d4r-patched vkd3d-proton. Proton loads DLLs from the game folder before `system32`. |
| `d4r\nvngx.dll`, `d4r\nvcuda.dll` | the shim and the CUDA bridge |
| `d4r\zluda\libcuda.so` | ZLUDA |
| `d4r\kernels\<gfx target>\` | native kernels and their manifest `d4r-kernels.txt` |
| `d4r\d4r.ini` | this game's settings |
| `d4r\nvngx_dlss.dll`, `d4r\ngx\_nvngx.dll` | NVIDIA's files (the packager's `D4R_BUNDLE_NVIDIA=0` leaves them for the user to add) |

**Settings.** When an `d4r.ini` sits next to the shim, the shim turns it into the same environment variables the developer launcher sets, with the release's defaults. A variable that is already set, for example in the launch options, wins. Settings for the Linux side (ZLUDA's and the bridge's) are handed to the bridge through `d4rSetEnv` right after it is loaded, before its first CUDA call.

**Loading ROCm.** Steam runs GE-Proton 11 inside its container runtime (SteamLinuxRuntime_4), whose library search path has no ROCm. The bridge therefore:
- loads HIP, HSA and comgr by path, from `RocmDir` (default: the release's bundled `d4r/rocm`, else `/opt/rocm`);
- looks up any dependency they lack in the host's library directories, which the container mounts under `/run/host`;
- sets `XDG_CACHE_HOME` only while ZLUDA initialises, so ZLUDA's kernel cache goes to `~/.cache/d4r` without affecting the rest of the game.

**Native kernel checks.** For each kernel, `d4r-kernels.txt` lists the hash of the DLSS PTX module it was written for. ZLUDA is pointed at a per-process directory, and the bridge adds a kernel to it only when NGX loads a module with a matching hash. A DLSS version whose kernel changed therefore gets ZLUDA's compile of that kernel: slower, but correct. The bridge picks the `gfx` folder from the GPU's KFD topology entry. `DirectOutput` takes effect only while the bridge reports that NGX uses a native `hiluma_engine_output_*` kernel. That kernel is one of the texture kernels built from NVIDIA's PTX, and it is worth about 3 fps for DLSS 4 at Quality.

**NGX identity and watermark.** A game that initialises NGX with a project ID (Unreal's DLSS plugin does) is passed to the NGX core's `NVSDK_NGX_CUDA_Init_ProjectID` with that ID. In this setup the DLSS library still stamps "DLSS SDK - DO NOT DISTRIBUTE" over its output. The shim sets the SDK's `Disable.Watermark` evaluation parameter unless `[DLSS] ShowWatermark = true` (`D4R_SHIM_WATERMARK=1`).

**NVAPI.** The launch option `PROTON_FORCE_NVAPI=1` makes Proton enable dxvk-nvapi on the AMD driver and set `WINE_HIDE_AMD_GPU`, so Windows sees an NVIDIA PCI ID. OptiScaler's NVIDIA check accepts that, so the NVAPI identity bridge is only needed by the developer launcher. `DXVK_NVAPI_GPU_ARCH=AD100` is still required, because NGX picks its weights by GPU architecture.

## Logs

The launcher writes each run's logs to `~/.cache/d4r-dlss-captures/game-<exe>-<time>/`. `d4r_nvngx.log` holds the shim's log. With `[Debug] Profile = true` it also records one `D4R_PROFILE` line per frame, with the stage timings.

For a CPU-use A/B check, set `D4R_SHIM_BLOCKING_SYNC = 1` under `[Env]` in the game's `d4r.ini`.
The VRAM path then requests a blocking event wait for its null-stream output. If ZLUDA and HIP
honour the event flag, the waiting thread yields the CPU; an unavailable or failed event falls back
to the original context sync. This is opt-in because it changes the wait scope and may add wakeup
latency. The profile reports `output_sync_wall`, `output_sync_cpu`, and `output_sync_blocking`;
compare CPU use and frame rate in the same scene.
The `d2h` field on this path includes the output synchronization wait, even when direct output
skips the array-to-buffer copy.
